# CVE-2017-12945
## Exploit for CVE-2017-12945
An authenticated blind OS command injection vulnerability exists in Solstice devices running versions of the firmware prior to 2.8.4. An authenticated attacker can craft specific requests to run commands (as root) on affected devices.

This vulnerability exists due to the lack of server-side inputs/parameters validation. Some user-controlled inputs/parameters are directly passed as arguments to a ‘public static String runShellCommand(String command)’ method designed to execute OS commands under the context of the root user. This insecure configuration could allow an attacker to fully compromise vulnerable devices.

## Affected versions
Solstice devices running versions of the firmware prior to 2.8.4.

## Affected components
com/mersive/solstice/server/EthernetInterface.java
com/mersive/solstice/server/ServerDisplay.java

## Attack vectors
To exploit this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker would need to send a specifically crafted request to devices running vulnerable version of the firmware (prior to 2.8.4). This request could either be sent directly from the device web interface (from the set static IP address form) itself, or alternatively, it could be sent using a command line utility such as cURL.

In either case, the payload would need to be preceded by a special character instructing ‘/bin/sh’ to run consecutive commands, e.g. the ‘;’ or ‘&’ character, for the payload to get executed after completion of the original/legitimate command.

The ‘staticIP’ parameter which is one of the multiple vulnerable parameters along with the ‘gateway’ parameter is not validated server-side and is instead directly passed as an argument to the 'static void SetStaticIP(String ipAddr)' method which in turn passes it as an argument to the ‘public static String runShellCommand(String command)’ method.

This configuration allows an authenticated attacker to run arbitrary commands on vulnerable devices under the context of the root user.
